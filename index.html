            <h1>The Value of Money</h1>

            <p>
                Money management is an extremely important skill that many people have a very difficult time grasping (Including myself). For many, even just thinking about money can cause a great deal of anxiety and stress, even though it is so vitally important since it can determine the quality of our life (since we all live within a capitalist society). In this brief essay I will go over several easy money management tips that should be able to set you off in the right direction and hopefully allow you to feel some sort of financial ease. Since many people struggle with math, and dont like even attempting basic arithmatic, I will try to focus on some simple tips and tricks that dont involve arithmatic to get your finances under control, but simply psychology (and maybe a little bit of budgetting). So let's get started, shall we?
                <br><br>
                The first simple tip I have is to pay more attention to your bank account. This simple act of checking your bank account on a daily basis will allow you to at least have a general understanding  of the finances you have flowing in and out. Many people avoid looking at their balance out of fear and anxiety, and although it will be tough at first, doping this simple task will pay off over time. As you start to just watch what you do with your money more closely and see what you have in your account, you will begin to feel that anxiety shift from a generalized anxiety about money to one that may be more specific about the individual issues. You may start to notice that you tend to spend too much on your credit card when you go to the corner store or the movies (maybe an old habbit that you dont even notice anymore but you will when you see those consistent numbers appear in your account).
                <br><br>
                The second tip I have is to carry around cash with you and use that instead of your credit or debit cards as often as you can. This simple task will make you more aware of the money you are spending. It is easy to just tap a plastic card on a screen and feel everything will work out, but when you are only dealing with exactly the cash in your wallet or purse, then you will begin to start paying more attention and naturally adjust. I know it sounds like bogus, but really this simple trick can help you immensly. think back to if you got an allowance from your parents. You were more likely to be concious and specific about how you spent your quarters. You knew what candy you wnated and how much it cost. You unsderstood that if you blew it all on pop rocks you couldnt also afford to get chocolate milk the following day. The concept is the same here. If you only have a set ammount of cash in your wallet per week you tend to be more explicit in where your money goes.
                <br><br>
                The third and final tip I have is to create a very simple budget and review it at least once per month. While this can seem daunting there are several ways to go about this that can make it a lot easier. One reccomendation is that if you can, find a financial adivsor. Maybe you can find one at your school, maybe you have family or friends that are accountants that could help you out for a small fee and if not then no big deal, you can make a very basic budget on your own. I suggest that if you can, use excel or some sort of system like that, but if you can't then that's okay too! Lets say we are writing all of this on a napkin, and each month you review this napkin so lets call it the "Budgetting Master Napkin". On this napkin write all of your income on one side. (From work, side gigs, etc). In the middle write your fixed expenses (car payment, rent etc). Now create a third row called somewhat fixed expenses. These are expenses that you know you will spend bt the ammount is uncertain. this could contain food, transportation etc. Make estimates based on your reciepts, your previous transactions that you can see in your bank account or even just make a guess based on some easy google searches (ex: Average spent on food for single person in canada per month). Now create your final section which will include money that you would like to spend things on. Be honest here, what do you get that you dont need. No shame, we all like extra things, but we also need to be honest. Now deduct the three last ammounts from your income and you can see how much you are spending over or too little. With that simple number you can begin to make actionable adjustments. At least having the knowledge in your mind will put you one step closer to financial freedom. Maybe that means only cutting down on extra coffees or maybe it means next time you get a car get it used and pay off your student loan. Obviously these are generalizations but having the knowledge of will set you in the right direction.
                <br><br>
                I hope these tips and tricks have been helpful to you as they ahve to me recently. I am slowly making my way towards financial freedom. Although I am not free yet, simply being equipped with these tools have relieved much anxiety and that is the goal here.
